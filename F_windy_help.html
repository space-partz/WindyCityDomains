                <h3>What is Shared Hosting?</h3>
                <p>Shared web hosting is the most affordable type of domain hosting available. You share a server with various companies, each with its own specified amount of storage space defined by the hosting package. This setup allows for cost-effective hosting solutions, accommodating possibly thousands of websites on the same server.</p>
