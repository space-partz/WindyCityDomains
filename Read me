Professors Update 04/15/24
 1. The website is called Windy City Domains. Its intention is to allow users to search the whois database for available domain names, allow those users to add their chosen domains to a cart with suuplemental services that may be offered during the experience, and finally checkout to purchase products.
 2. We only have two members left and we have divided the workload evenly. We have assigned the home, services and help page FAQ's to Muhammad. Ken has taken the content and styling of the security and company pages. We will continue to meet for support and modificatrion of duty needs as we continue.
 3. Post research and design prototyping we created a HTML and CSS framework that was similar to our Figma design prototype. We accomplished this in about four hours during two seperate meetings. We have continued to pull content from our research and styling from the book, class lessons, and the MDN Web Docs. We have created all 5 pages we intend to implement. but have yet to determine the video, audio or images that will complete the look.
